# `ex_em_ell` & `ex_em_ell_derive`

`ex_em_ell` is an opinionated XML library based on the excellent
[`xml-rs`](https://crates.io/crates/xml-rs) library. It provides to/from traits
and derive macros to reduce boilerplate required when using the underlying
library.

For more information, see the [`ex_em_ell` `README.md`](ex_em_ell/README.md).

## Project Status

This project is currently in an alpha state and the API is expected to go
through rounds of iteration before reaching a `1.x.y` release. In its current
state, it is being developed based on the needs of specific features for
projects, rather than based on a specific roadmap.
